### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

The topics discussed in the labs were helpful to completing the assignemnt by showing me how to connect front end with backend. I felt prepared to complete the project.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time I would add more products and implement pagination to be more effective when fetching the orders. I would have added additional features like a receipt page.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

It went well doing the crud functions for the backend. The things that did not went as planned were connecting the front end and black end until I finally figured it out. Something that my peer did that I would like to implement is the receipt orders.
